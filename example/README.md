# Example

The [`app/`](app) directory contains an example C application that showcases a fairly complete appling lifecycle along with system specific resources for the application bundle. Once the example application has been built, a complete application bundle can be installed using [`cmake --install`](https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/manual/cmake.1.html#install-a-project). Make sure to pass the [`--prefix`](https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/manual/cmake.1.html#cmdoption-cmake--install-0) flag to install the application bundle in a place appropriate for your system, such as `/Applications` on macOS or `C:\Program Files` on Windows. The `install/` directory in the root of the repository may also be used and is included in [`.gitignore`](../.gitignore).

When opening the application, it will unpack and install its bundled platform into the [`pear/`](pear) directory and launch its associated Pear application. The bundled Pear runtime, [`test/fixtures/runtime.c`](../test/fixtures/runtime.c), is a small program that just prints `argv` to standard output and then exits to allow you to inspect the parameters that the appling passed to the runtime. To inspect the standard output, start the application binary directly from a terminal.
